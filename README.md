# Features ðŸ’¡
* Atomic and Independent test cases
* Robust Locator strategies to target elements
* No hard coded strings and test data in spec files
* Hooks to perform the repeated steps for all the tests inside spec
* Loading test data from external fixtures files i.e. JSON
* Generate random test data with faker library
* Loading environment specific configuration and environment variables per environment i.e. dev, stage, prod
* Ability to filter and run tests with specific tags i.e. regression, smoke
* Pass browser and mode as environment variable
* Configure routes (URL endpoints) in a constant config file
* Usage of OOP Inheritance to extend all the pages from BasePage
  * Allows to load header and footer components from BasePage constructor
  * Call the `cy.visit()` from BasePage with specified path
* Test Retries for failing tests
* Custom commands for login and validation in `cypress/support/commands.js`
* Intellisense for custom commands in `cypress/support/index.d.ts`
* Reusable test utilities functions inside `cypress/e2e/utils` 
* Multiple reporters configuration (JUnit XML, cpress-mochawesome-reporter HTML) 

# How to start :
1. Clone the project : `git clone https://github.com/YogeshBorole1998/Cypress-Automation-Examples.git`
2. Navigate to folder and open terminal
3. `npm i` - Install all the dependencies
4. There are a lot dependencies that are not updated frequently in parallel with cypress. So while installing if you are seeing conflicts use`npm i --force`.
5. Run `npx cypress open` to execute the tests in Test Runner | Run `npx cypress run` to execute the tests in CLI

## Introduction

- This repository provides practical examples of Cypress usage for automated testing. Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework for modern web applications.
- Cypress is JavaScript End to End Testing Framework. It's fast, easy, and reliable testing tool for anything that runs in a browser.
- Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.
- Test-Runner --> Free (Locally Installed) & Dashboard --> Paid
- Cypress works on top on node.js environment & comes package as npm module. 
- Difference between Selenium & Cypress : <br></br>

## Test Reporting ðŸ“‘

* This framework uses [cypress-mochawesome-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-mochawesome-reporter) to generate HTML test reports.
* Add the following options to `cypress.config.js`
  ```js
   //cypress-mochawesome-reporter
  reporter: 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter',  
  reporterOptions: {
    charts: true, //Genarates Chart in HTML report
    reportPageTitle: 'OpenCart Test Report', //Report title will be set to the mentioned string
    embeddedScreenshots: true, //Screenshot will be embedded within the report
    inlineAssets: true, //No separate assets folder will be created
    videoOnFailOnly: false, //If Videos are recorded and added to the report, setting this to true will add the videos only to tests with failures.
  },
  ```
* HTML Reports are generated by default in `root/cypress/reports` folder.
* It embeds the screenshots of tests on failure automatically to the report, and also attaches the videos to report. 
* It also allows the customization of report with better control of how and where report is generated.
* This is how the report dashboard looks like:

* Some ther reporting possibilities are:
  * [mochawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome)
  * [cypress-allure-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin)
  
* If a test case is failed, then the assertion error, screenshot and video gets attached to report automatically. 
  * When a test retries, Cypress will continue to take screenshots for each failed attempt or cy.screenshot() and suffix each new screenshot with (attempt n), corresponding to the current retry attempt number.
